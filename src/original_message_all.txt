the lord is my shepherd, i shall not be in want.
he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,
he restores my soul. he guides me in paths of righteousness for his name~s sake.
e?en though i walk through the ?alley of the shadow of death, i will fear no e?il, for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they ?omfort me.
you prepare a table before me in the presen?e of my enemies. you anoint my head with oil my ?up o?erflows.
surely goodness and lo?e will follow me all the days of my life, and i will dwell in the house of the lord fore?er.
